# Chopsticks
Chopsticks is a VHDL implementation of the hand/counting game which is played by two people. At the moment I have been debugging this code primarily in ModelSim using a testbench I've created. In the future I will use two Altera DE-II boards for the physical input/output.

#Instruction
The following image demonstrates the instruction codes for each possible hand and direction combination.

This is my first time using github, so i'll be updating information when I can.
