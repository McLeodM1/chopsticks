# Chopsticks
Chopsticks is a VHDL implementation of the hand/counting game which is played by two people. In the future I will use FPGA boards for the physical input.

This is my first time using github, so i'll be updating information when I can. 


#Instruction
The following image demonstrates the instruction codes for each possible hand and direction combination.
